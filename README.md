# VEDA Research and Development Playground 

A catch all repository to park quick proof of concept implementations of the VEDA Analytics Platform usecases. 

The goal is to build end to end demonstrable use cases to interact with scientists, refine use cases and then properly engineer solutions into the VEDA platform.
